### 3. Download and Paste the Plugin:
   - Paste the downloaded plugin into the "Plugins" folder you created.

### 4. Generate VS Project Files:

   - Open the Visual Studio project.
   - Build the project in Visual Studio.

## Usage
   - A simple, fully functional design is included called WBP_NetworkInformation. 

#### Use our design:
   - You can easily access it by creating a new Widget blueprint or going in to an existing one. 
   - In the add components tab, just search for WBP_NetworkInformation. 
   - Set the anchors to fullscreen as well as making sure left, right, top and bottom offsets are 0.

#### Make your own design:
   - If you wish to create your own design:

### 1. Create Blueprint:
   - Right-click in the Content Browser and select "Blueprint."

### 2. Search and Create UNetworkInformation:
   - Search for "UNetworkInformation" and click to create.
   - You now have access to exclusive variables not available in Blueprints without the plugin:
     - InBytesPerSecond
     - OutPacketLoss
     - InPacketLoss
     - OutBytesPerSecond
     - InPacketsPerSecond
     - OutPacketsPerSecond
     - bHasValidNetConnection

### 3. Access Variables:
   - Right-click in the Blueprint graph and search for the desired variables.

### 4. Update Variables:
   - To update all variables, call the Blueprint-exposed "Update Net Stats Function." In the example, this is done on tick.
### 5. Set bad variables
   - There are exposed variables in the widget. Those are called:
     - Bad ping
     - Bad packet loss out
     - Bad packet loss in
   - They decide when a connection is bad. We would recommend to leave them at default.
### Show case:
   - Very bad connection
